## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ If you have some knowledge in the domain of ML, I think there are things you can contribute to regarding documentation and some simple issues. Though I wouldn't really reccomend this project for contributions, as they generally don't want any algothrimic contributions, only documentation and the webui.




__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ They are quite active in certain issues.



__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ The discord seems friendly.




__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes, the owners are quick to response.



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Doesn't seem like it



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ Knowledge of python, pytorch, and basic ML principles



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ A gpu while useful, is not required.
