__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ It was easy to find the GitHub repo because there was a link to it on the website nav. However, the CONTRIBUTING.md doesn't have actual information on how to contribute, only a link to a reporting guide, so it could be difficult for newcomers to contribute to the project.
