## Development Environment 

Each member of your group should attempt to configure the development environemnt 
for this project. Complete the following for each member:

Name: Brandon Chen

Operating system: Windows 11

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it) 

The project listed 3 ways to setup for contributing. One was to use Gitpod which clones the repo, install dependencies, and runs yarn start. This was successful but Gitpod usage is limited to 10 hours or 50 hours when linked to LinkedIn per month. I was able to use the second method of github.dev which did allow me to edit but I am not sure if it was runnable (most likely not). The last method was to install yarn and run yarn workspace website start. There was some difficulty when running yarn install with "Some peer dependencies are incorrectly met" and the workspace not being built successfully. I am still unable to resolve this issue and would require more research as to what react version it is asking for.

How long did the whole process take? Gitpod was quick but spent 30 mins on yarn install issues before giving up.
