## Development Environment 

Each member of your group should attempt to configure the development environemnt 
for this project. Complete the following for each member:

Name: Andrew

Operating system: Windows

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it) I was able to get everything up and running, but upon going into the frontend of the local environment, the sign in functionality seems to be broken for me, and not being able to sign in locally makes it impossible to access the actual software. 

How long did the whole process take? 30 minutes
