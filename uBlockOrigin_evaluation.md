## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
Not extremely extremely friendly, however, it was surprisingly beginnger friendly and with the tags for wiki and good first issues, it looks like they are making an effort to improve beginner friendliness.



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Sometimes they can be a little brisk if you bring up an issue that has either been disucssed before or perhaps a comment that makes it clear you did not configure your build properly or read the README. Otherwise, the maintainers respond helpfully, critically, and quickly.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Similar vibe to discussion on github, if you properly report an issue (include your platform, what build, etc.), then people will answer seriously, if you do not, people will ask you to somewhat briskly.



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
For the ones I looked at, generally no. The closest thing I saw was a "looks good."


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
JavaScript is very helpful since it is a browser extension, similarly, HTML and CSS knowledge also helpful but not as important.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Very loose ones, this project supports Firefox, Chromium, Thunderbird and Node.js for its development build.
