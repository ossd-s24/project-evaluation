## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

The contributing instruction and development environment are concise and easy to set up. However, they aren't that quick to respond to issues nor is there a lot of discussion.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

Most of the discussion is happening in the slack channel. There aren't that many maintainers or contributors so the discussion seems quite dead.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

Once again, not much discussion is happening but from what little is there, people seem friendly


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Pull requests do get reviewed.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Maintainers do thank people for their contributions. However, the maintainers seem to be doing most of the work.


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

PHP, React, Javascript, Flask, and Pythong knowledge. Maybe some ML knowledge if you wish to contribute to the source material.
