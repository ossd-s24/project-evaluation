__What is the purpose of the project:__ Mockito is a Java mocking framework with no expect-run-verify, and offers an approach where "you ask questions about interactions after execution". 


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ It wasn't super easy to find off the bat, because the link about how to contribute is all the way towards the bottom of the home page. In addition, when navigating to the contributing link, you can see that the CONTRIBUTING.md is under a hidden directory in the Mockito repository.
