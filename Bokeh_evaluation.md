Yes, the maintainers are very active in responding to specific questions

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Yes from what I can tell



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Mostly!


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
No not that i've seen.


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Web graphics is a big plus for working in the typescript/rendering portion of the project.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
I can't speak to it's efficacy on non macos machines but it says it's supported on windows as well.
