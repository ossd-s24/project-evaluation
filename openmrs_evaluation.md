## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

Not very friendly. The project itself is quite complicated and it will take a long time for beginner to be onboarded to the development process, especially consider all issues are listed on a separate jira board which needs to be requested access to.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

I could not really tell as I do not have access to the jira board. 

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

Again, I could not really tell as I do not have access to the jira board.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes, but also some of them are only reviewed by a bot. 

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Not from what I observed.

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Java skills are preferred.

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

No.
