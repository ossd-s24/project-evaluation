## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

Not the friendlist project. It seems like a lot of issues and and pull requests are very niche. If the contributor have used yfinance before, that will make contributions a lot easier


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

Yes. Maintainers does reply to PR/issues on a very frequent basis and provide clarifications and insights to the issue listed.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

There is not really any communication so it is hard to tell, but for the most part I think maintainers response pretty friendly.



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes. Very frequently

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Not from what I can tell. 

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Technical wise, there are no special skill and all contributors need to know is how to interact with a public API. However, I think some background knowledge and/or interests in finance could help a lot to understand the context of the issue.



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
