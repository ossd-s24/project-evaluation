__What is the purpose of the project:__ Help people learn to code, build projects, and earn certifications for free.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ It was relatively easy to find information about contributing. A link in the main menu led to the contribute page, which listed various ways of contributing to the community: answering coding questions, giving project feedback, translating, and contributing to the GitHub codebase. There were shortcut links for each way of contributing as well as a button to see contributing guidelines.
