## Development Environment 

Each member of your group should attempt to configure the development environemnt 
for this project. Complete the following for each member:

Name: Brandon Chen

Operating system: Windows 11

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it) Installation was successful but running locally is another problem. There are many steps for running it locally which requires docker, redux dev tools, getting past email verification, etc.

How long did the whole process take? About 15-30 mins for installation. Did not try running it locally but would take much longer.
