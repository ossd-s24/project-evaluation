## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)


__What is the purpose of the project:__ Help people learn to code, build projects, and earn certifications for free.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ It is relatively easy to find information about contributing. A link in the main menu led to the contribute page, and the page listed various ways of contributing to the community: answering coding questions, giving project feedback, translating, and contributing to the GitHub codebase. There were also shortcut links for each way of contributing as well as a button to see contributing guidelines.
