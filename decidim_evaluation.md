## Development Environment 

Each member of your group should attempt to configure the development environemnt 
for this project. Complete the following for each member:

Name: Brad Huang

Operating system: Windows 11 and OSX

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it)
Not successful on windows but I went on my mac to install ruby& gem and it was super easy.
On PC, either you install ruby in a very convuloted way or you can WSL. WSL is kind of weird too in the sense that you cant really update GEM without breaking it. So yeah do it on unix systems to make it much easier.

How long did the whole process take? 
1 hour
