## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
The project is relatively beginner-friendly. It is not extremely friendly because there aren't a lot of issues to solve as a beginner but there are a few. The setup of the development does take time too. 



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
The maintainers are relatively helpful in answering questions, although, they might not always respond on GitHub. I think they are more responsive in their chat channel. 


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
They are friendly. You are allowed to introduce yourself which helps to create a community that knows and acknowledges you. 



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Pull requests do get reviewed and relatively quickly. 



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ They do not thank people for their  contribution, at least, I have not seen it so far. 



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ People who want to contribute should have a good understanding of Python and Javascript. Those are the top languages.



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ The requirement is to have your own proxy and to follow their recommended environment. There are no specific requirements but hard "recommendations" that are illustrated in their developer guide.
