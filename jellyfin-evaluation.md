## Development Environment 

Each member of your group should attempt to configure the development environment 
for this project. Complete the following for each member:

Name: Allyson

Operating system: Windows 10

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it)
It was successful, there were some hiccups that involved me trying different combinations of the various methods of installation Jellyfin wrote in their README.md and closely inspecting console logs for any errors that may be causing issues. This project required a lot of prerequisite software to be installed outside of the usual Node.js/.Net/etc., such as FFMPEG and the Jellyfin web server.

How long did the whole process take? 
About an hour.

Name: Julissa

Operating system: macOS

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it)
It was successful in the end, however, there were a lot of redos, my teammates helping me, and searching online. The good part was that there were different methods to use for the installation but not all worked on my computer. The installation of DotNote that they mentioned did not work for me, instead, I had to use Brew. There were a lot of steps to follow that made a bit confusing, and I had to recheck my steps to see if I had everything set up and downloaded. There were a couple of times that I forgot to download a prerequisite. 

How long did the whole process take? 
Two hours

Name: Johan

Operating system: macOS

Was the installation successful? 
(if not, explain what went wrong and what you did to try to remedy it)
The installation was successful after a long process of re-reading the documentation and trying different options to start the server. Jellyfin gave a lot of details on different ways to set up the project but it was always missing small tiny details in some given options which caused me to continue searching for more details before going on to the next option. Also, there were many dependencies required for the project which all had their own long instructions which tired me out from reading. I was easily able to have the project installed using one method but then I worked longer to figure out a different method which seemed more practical as it combined the client with the server automatically. I also used my previous knowledge of node to help me debug some errors I recieved when building the client and the server. 


How long did the whole process take? 
An hour and a half

People are friendly and try to be helpful, there is a Code Of Conduct and maintainers try to enforce good behavior.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Pull Requests do get reviewed. 

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Not particularily.


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Nothing special, but maybe more experience with web development.
